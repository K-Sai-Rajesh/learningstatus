	Looping Function :

			for 		: 
				in 	:	iterates the keys of an object, iterates the indices of an array  
				of 	:	iterates the values of an array
			while :		:	The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
			do-while	:	The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested
		
	Array iteration methods : ( ES6 )
		
			forEach()			:	a function is called for each item in the array
			map()				:	creates a new array without changing the original array, calls a function for each value
			filter()			:	creates a new array without changing the original array, calls a function for each value to return a value that satisfies a particular condition
			reduce()			:	converges an entire array to a single entrie, it doesnot affects the original array
				reduceRight() 
			Array.from()			:	
			Array.keys()			:	returns an array of indices
			array.entries()			:	returns an iterable array of key,value pairs
			
			
	Array Methods :
			array.includes()		:	returns a boolean value that satisfies/doesnt satisfies the condition of the given function
			array.sort()			:	sorts out the given array either alpabetically / numerically (increasing order)
			array.reverse()			:	sorts out the given array either alpabetically / numerically (decreasing order)
			find()				:	returns the first item that satisfies the condition
			findIndex()			:	returns the index of the first item that satisfies the condition
			every()				:	returns a boolean value if the condition is satified by every item of the array 
			some()				:	returns a boolean value if the condition is satified by some of even one item of the array
			indexOf() 			:	returns the index of a particular entry sent as an argument if it is present in the array			
				lastIndexOf()		:	returns the last appearing index of an array particular entry sent as an argument.
			array.toString()
			array.join(delimeter)
			array.pop()
			array.push()
			array.length
			delete keyword from deleting an item in an array : "delete array[index]"
			shift()
			unshift()

			splice(1,2,'','')  // 1 specifies the index from where the items to be added or removed, 2 specifies no. of items to be removed from 1 index
